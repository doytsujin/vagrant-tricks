# Randomized forwarded ports

Sometimes you run lots of vagrants, and it's annoying to hand-manage port
forwards (you know, so things don't conflict).

Easy fix: randomize the ports!

See the `Vagrantfile` in this repo for a fully working example.

You should also check out the vagrant-port plugin to query the forwarded port
settings for vms for use with scripts.
